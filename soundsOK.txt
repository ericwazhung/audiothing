a/o v52-0:
v52's only change was replacing 'ADCL/H' reads with 'ADC'
   and apparently didn't affect functionality
v51-latest actually sounds OK despite odd-timing on printout
v51-11 sounds shitty, and notably about half an octave shifted
   That might make sense, if the fullCount of 2700/second was *not* due to
   the puat printouts (which also seems to be the case)
   (a/o v53: DUH. writingSD() handles printout, and has cli/sei around it)
??? Why is the fullCount so large, when not noticed on the Tiny861?
   ...v51-11 ctd:
   2700/19200 is 14%, each octave is doubled in frequency, so it's an
   exponential scale, 14% might be a couple/few notes...?
   PRINTOUT occurs NON-spurradically

Functional Changes between v51-11 and v52:
 ADC <-- ADCL/H
 (prior to v51-11: sei/cli removed from ISR)
 tcnter_get() --> tcnter_isItTime() in printout
   As I recall, this was done *because* printout was spurradic 
      (prior to v51-11?)
      And remains so
 cirBuff_get() --> cirBuff_getSafe()
   "Doesn't seem to affect the problems encountered"
      re: spurradic printing? Or audio?
 !!! SDWU_WRITE_SEVERAL_SAMPLES
   clears the cirBuff in a single call to sd_writeUpdate()
      introduction led to spurradic printout
 (PRINT_BWandWBC=TRUE)
   
v53: re: spurradic printout:
   writingSD() which handles periodic printout had an "if(fullcount)" DUH.

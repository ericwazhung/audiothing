It's been a while since I've done much with the tests here...

The latest is testMega328p, it was copied, somewhat arbitrarily, from
testTiny861+NonBlocking and modified as necessary


These dates are likely off due to copying, etc.
But the order does seem relative to my recollection
2-14-14: test
5-3-14:  testTiny861
5-3-14:  testTiny861+NonBlocking
5-11-14: testPWM161
5-11-14: testPWM161+capacitancePlate

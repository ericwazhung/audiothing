This (appears to be) is the pinout for the LCDdirect Tiny84 board:

From LCDdirectLVDS.../makefile:
#TINY84
#This is ONLY for 6bitParallel (NOT LVDS)
#This is not the normal pin for heartbeat (on the programming-header)
# As that pin is used by blue1, was planning on shifting blue1, but that'd
# interfere with MCK, and whatnot... this is easier.
CFLAGS += -D'HEART_PINPORT=PORTB'
CFLAGS += -D'HEART_PINNUM=PB2'
